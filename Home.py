    ***Binary variables*** are metrics that only have two options. Examples are:
         - conversion (did users spend or no?)
         - click rates (did users click a link?)
         - retention (did users retain on d7 or no?)

    ***Continuous variables*** are metrics that can be any value along a continuous scale. Examples are:
        - total amount spent
        - average frame rate
        - total matches played
